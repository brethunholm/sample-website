            <h2>Cruise Maui’s Pristine Waters in Style</h2>
            <p>Sail along with our happy crew on our 100% zero emissions sloop out of Maalaea Harbor. An Islander ’44, Shadowfax is a blue water sailer having logged multiple South Pacific trips. Converted for day sailing around the beautiful waters of Maalaea, she is a beautiful platform for private morning snorkel trips, evening sunset cruises or just a day sail to get out and feel the Maui trade winds.</p>
            <p>Maalaea is conveniently located a short drive form the resort areas of Kihei and Wailea to the south or Lahaina and Kaanapali to the west.</p>
            <p>Shadowfax crew customizes private yacht charters to make your trip the best part of your Maui experience. Maui has so much to offer, but you can’t see it from your hotel.</p>
            <p>Let’s Go Sailing!</p>

    <h2>Come See The Real Maui</h2>
    <p>If you really want to see Maui, you have to get off that pool chaise and get on the boat. Shadowfax crew customizes private yacht charters to make your trip the best part of your Maui Nui experience. Maui has so much to offer, but you can’t see it from your hotel. LET’S GO SAILING!</p>
    <h2>Lahaina – Maui’s Whaling Town</h2>
    <p>Old Lahaina Town – Most beautiful seen from the water… Where the waters are reliably calm. Lana’i, The Pineapple Isle, is only 9 miles away, making it an fun and easy over-nighter. Kapalua Bay, just around the corner also makes a great spot to anchor, with Merriman’s Kapalua, just ashore, your only limit is your heart’s desire.</p>
    <h2>Lovely West Maui</h2>
    <p>The West Maui Mountains are unmatched in their drama & beauty. Sail, Snorkel & Whale Watch (in season), it’s the very best Maui has to offer. From Ma’alaea or Lahaina, The West Maui’s are easily accessible for a day trip.</p>
    <h2>Kanaio Coast</h2>
    <p>The Kanaio​ ​​Coast on Maui’s South Shore offers some of the most​​ ​dramatic in lava formations in the state. When the trade winds come down, this is a most magical spot. Spend the night in La​ ​​Perouse Bay. Look for dolphins in the morning. It’s a once-in-a-lifetime experience.​</p>
